# AccordiLytics 
A simple windows based software to perform exploratory data analysis, dimensionality reduction and predictive modeling. This software enables users to generate &amp; visualize feature statistics, class distributions, feature cross-plots, correlations, principal components and confusion matirx.
It uses Accord.NET framework for performing machine learning & statistics operations.

# Installing
To install AccordiLytics simply run the attached setup.exe file and follow the instructions.

# Sample Project

Let's follow the step by step guide to create a machine learning supervised classification model in AccordiLytics. The data used here is the famous breast cancer diagonistic dataset available at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/breast+cancer+wisconsin+%28diagnostic%29. The input data is required to be imported in csv format for each of the training and the test sets. This program requires column headers and class column should be the last column. The import buttons followed by Load Data button create the essential data structures to be used for further operations.
